Description: 
        Tkinter Rapid Application Development (RAD) library.
        
        `tkRAD` is a **Python3.2+** library designed to enable really Rapid
        Application Development (RAD) process by using predefined classes to
        derive in your own subclasses, with quite useful embedded services
        such as dynamic **Tkinter XML widget building**, service manager,
        events manager, RC configuration manager and so on.
        
        `tkRAD` is a deliberately **short-made API** designed for comfort,
        easiness and simplicity.
        
        `tkRAD` provides the necessary **core tools** to quickly start up an
        application development or for Tkinter widget testing through
        `tkRAD.easy.builder` module.
